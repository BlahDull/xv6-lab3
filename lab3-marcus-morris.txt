ESTIMATE of time to complete the lab: 14 hours

Date	Start Time	Time Spent	Lab Part	Work Completed
-----	----------	----------	--------	--------------
10/11	6:00		9:00		3		Research assignment, completed the exercise
10/13	2:00		5:00		4		Research task 4, studied priority scheduling, modified the scheduler
10/14	9:00		11:00		4		Modified lab3test.c to show priority scheduling, error checking then completion
			----------
			8:00 TOTAL time spent


Major difficulties: The major difficulty for task 3 was figuring out exactly what we needed in order to have the parent wait for the 
child to complete. It was actually a lot simpler than I expected. All we needed was a single wait() function call in order to have
the parent wait for the child to complete. The only issue after this was the printing of the results, where it would sometimes print
randomly when the lab3test.c was executed. The major issue with task 4 was showing how the priority scheduler was working. Modifiying the
scheduler function was not a huge issue, but it did cause some problems. However, showing how the scheduler worked was a massive issue.
Eventually, I had to modify the lab3test.c in order to include the priority to get it to work properly.
